# Three Instance Kubernetes Cluster

This project aims to provide a hello world on a three-instance Kubernetes cluster established with Terraform and configured with Ansible.

As a derived work, this project builds on prior art in the field, namely [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and its automated equvivalent [Kubernetes Not the Hardest Way](https://opencredo.com/kubernetes-aws-terraform-ansible-1/).
